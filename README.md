# Motor-Speed-and-Temperature-Control-System
Embedded Motor Speed Control System with Dual Operation Modes The objective of this project was to design an embedded control system using the TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller to manage the speed and direction of a geared DC motor. It features two control modes—manual and automatic—and uses a PID controller for closed-loop control.
